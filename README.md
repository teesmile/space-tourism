## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Flexbox** & **CSS Grid** for layout
- **Mobile-first** responsive workflow
- **React** for component-based UI
- **Next.js** for routing and performance optimizations
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations

### What I learned

This project reinforced my skills in:

- Building **multi-page layouts** with Next.js routing
- Creating **responsive designs** that adapt cleanly from mobile â†’ tablet â†’ desktop
- Implementing **tabbed navigation** with state management
- Using **Tailwind's responsive utilities** to control layout at different breakpoints
- Animating UI elements with **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions

Example: Tab switching logic for the Technology page

```tsx
const [selected, setSelected] = useState(0);

return (
  <div className="flex gap-4">
    {tech.map((_, i) => (
      <button
        key={i}
        onClick={() => setSelected(i)}
        className={`w-10 h-10 rounded-full ${
          selected === i ? "bg-white text-black" : "bg-transparent text-white"
        }`}
      >
        {i + 1}
      </button>
    ))}
  </div>
);
 ```
 ## Continued development

In the future, Iâ€™d like to:

- Add **ARIA roles** and improved keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Implement **dark mode** toggle
- Explore **server-side data fetching** for dynamic content
- Add **unit tests** for components
